## Which Program I Joint: Navigating the World of Computational Social Science Opportunities
1. **Computational Social Science Basics**: Learn data handling and machine learning with Python, understand computational social science principles, and gain insights into natural language processing and network science.

2. **Machine Learning & Network Science**: Explore supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning using Scikit-Learn. Analyze network structures and models with Network X, and their applications in health, security, and epidemic forecasting.

3. **Word2vec and NLP Skills**: Master word embedding with Word2vec, train models with Gensim, and analyze text data. Understand sentiment analysis techniques and text mining practices using Python.

## What I Have Done in the Program: Course Projects and Capstone
### Course Projects
- **HW1**: Read a txt file containing 16,949 lines of the English version of The Republic in Python, clean the read file, calculate the frequency of occurrence of each word, and write the 100 most frequent words and their frequency to the hard disk.
- **HW2**: Processed a 16,949-line text file of The Republic using Python to analyze word frequency and extracted and wrote the 100 most frequent words along with their frequency to a file on the hard disk.
- **HW3**: Using publicly available experimental result data, reproduced the analysis in Matthew J. Salganik's dissertation project "Experimental Study of Inequality and Unpredictability in an Artificial Cultural Market", supervised by Duncan J. Watts.

### Capstone
- **Topic**: The impact of social participation on the mental health of the elderly - A study taking pension institutions as the participation platform.
- **Awards**: Third Place and Best Research Question Award in Research Track
- I collaborated with a partner to analyze the supply characteristics of elderly institutions and the demand of the elderly in Shanghai from a geospatial perspective. We empirically explored the impact of social activity participation on the mental health of the elderly using the CHARLS database. I was responsible for the empirical analysis, and the data and code have been uploaded.
- The conclusion is that various types of senior care institutions are mainly concentrated in the central urban areas, the elderly groups in the peripheral urban areas have fewer chances to come into contact with senior care institutions, and the spatial distribution of supply and demand is unbalanced, but there is spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of the three types of institutions, which can complement the demand for senior care to a certain extent. Participation in social activities can improve the mental health of the elderly, and elderly care institutions play a key role in improving the mental health of the elderly.
